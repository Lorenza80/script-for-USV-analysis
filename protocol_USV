##protocol  USV analysis

##setting working directory

##creating csv file using reading_function (video file name as ID)

##tyding data before proceeding (check if nas have been introduced, check ther's no strange value)

USVL <- read.csv("USV_DF.csv") 

##reading csv containing info about videos and subjects

USVL_list <- read.csv("list name.csv") #list file in same folder

##tyding csv containing info about videos and subjects

##merging csv

merged_USVL <- merge(USVL, USVL_list, by.x = "ID") 

##creating merged file

write.csv(merged_USVL, file = "USVL merged.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  
##loading dplyr and filtering by age and gender eg P4 males

P4M <- filter(merged_USV2, age == "P4", sex =="M")

##statistics
# merged_USV2 %>%
#   group_by(age, sex, genotype) %>%
#   select(arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
#   summarise(
#     arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
#     dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
#   ) %>%
#   filter(arr > 30 | dep > 30)
